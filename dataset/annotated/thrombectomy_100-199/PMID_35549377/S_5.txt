In a multivariate logistic regression analysis , probability of good outcome was significantly associated with age ( odds ratio [ 0.95 CI ] , 0.95 [ 0.94 - 0.96 ] ) , prestroke modified Rankin Scale ( 0.48 [ 0.42 - 0.55 ] ) , admission-NIHSS ( 0.96 [ 0.94 - 0.98 ] ) , 24-hour NIHSS ( 0.83 [ 0.81 - 0.84 ] ) , diabetes ( 0.56 [ 0.43 - 0.72 ] ) , proximal middle cerebral artery occlusions ( 0.78 [ 0.62 - 0.97 ] ) , passes ( 0.88 [ 0.82 - 0.95 ] ) , Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score ( 1.07 [ 1.00 - 1.14 ] ) , successful recanalization ( 2.39 [ 1.68 - 3.43 ] ) , intracerebral hemorrhage ( 0.51 [ 0.35 - 0.73 ] ) , and recurrent strokes ( 0.54 [ 0.32 - 0.92 ] ) .
