Higher age ( odds ratio = 1.10 [ 1.05 ; 1.16 ] ) , adverse events during treatment ( 9.46 [ 1.52 ; 72.5 ] ) and until discharge ( 18.34 [ 2.33 ; 172 ] ) and high NIHSS scores at 24 h ( 1.29 [ 1.10 ; 1.53 ] ) were independent predictors for turning the outcome prognosis from good ( mRS < / = 3 ) to poor ( mRS > / = 4 ) .
