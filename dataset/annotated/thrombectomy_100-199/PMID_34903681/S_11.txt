Patients with residual hypoperfusion had larger lesion growth on diffusion-weighted imaging ( 59 mL vs. 8 mL , p < 0.001 ) , lower rate of major early neurological improvement ( 0.24 vs. 0.7 , p = 0.002 ) at 24 h , and worse long-term outcome based on the modified Rankin Scale at 30 or 90 days , 5 versus 2 ( p < 0.001 ) .
