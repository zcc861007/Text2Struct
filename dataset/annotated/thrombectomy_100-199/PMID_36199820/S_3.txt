Results : After treatment , the values of brain symmetry index ( BSI ) and power ratio indices ( DTABR ) in the two groups were obviously lower than those before treatment ( P < 0.05 ) , and the values of BSI and DTABR in the mechanical thrombectomy group were lower than those in the thrombolytic treatment group ( P < 0.05 ) .
