Outcome was dichotomized ( modified Rankin Scale 0 - 2 , favorable , and 3 - 6 , unfavorable ) and associated with systolic BPV ( as calculated by using standard deviation , coefficient of variation , averaged real variability , successive variation , number of trend changes , and a spectral approach using the power of specific BP frequencies ) .
