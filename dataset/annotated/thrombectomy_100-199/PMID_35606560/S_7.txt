BPV only reached predictive significance when using successive variation extracted from downsampled ( averaged over 5 min ) SBP data ( median 4.8 mm Hg [ range 3.8 - 7.1 ] ) in patients with favorable versus 7.1 mmHg [ range 5.5 - 9.7 ] in those with unfavorable outcome , area under the curve = 0.74 [ confidence interval ( CI ) 0.57 - 0.85 ; p = 0.031 ] , or the power of midrange frequencies between 1 / 20 and 1 / 5 min [ area under the curve = 0.75 ( CI 0.59 - 0.86 ) , p = 0.020 ] .
