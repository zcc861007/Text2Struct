Logistic regression analysis found that shorter change of CCT of the stroke side versus CCT of the healthy side and CCT of the stroke side were independent positive prognostic factors for dramatic clinical recovery ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.189 ; P = 0.033 ; OR , 0.581 ; P = 0.035 ) and favorable outcomes ( OR , 0.142 ; P = 0.020 ; OR , 0.581 ; P = 0.046 ) after adjustment for potential confounders .
