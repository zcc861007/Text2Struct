In multivariate analysis , an older age ( odds ratio [ OR ] 0.89 [ 0.95 confidence interval 0.83 - 0.96 ] , P = 0.003 ) , longer puncture to recanalization time ( OR 0.97 [ 0.93 - 0.99 ] , P = 0.033 ) , and higher baseline core volume ( OR 0.84 [ 0.75 - 0.94 ] , P = 0.003 ) decreased the probability of good clinical outcomes , while a final complete ( or near- ) recanalization ( modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction [ mTICI ] score 2c-3 ) increased the probability of good outcome ( OR 14.19 [ 1.99 - 101.4 ] , P = 0.008 ) .
