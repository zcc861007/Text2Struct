RESULTS : ASPECTS declined during transfer ( 9 ( 8 - 10 ) vs 7 ( 6 - 9 ) , p < 0.0001 ) , resulting in lower ASPECTS at stroke center presentation ( mothership 9 ( 7 - 10 ) vs drip and ship 7 ( 6 - 9 ) , p < 0.0001 ) and on follow-up imaging ( mothership 7 ( 4 - 8 ) vs drip and ship 6 ( 3 - 7 ) , p = 0.001 ) compared with mothership patients .
