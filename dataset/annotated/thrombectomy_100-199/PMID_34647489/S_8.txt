Via multivariate analysis , we found that frontal lobe non-reperfusion ( mean difference ( MD ) = -1.60 , p = 0.002 ) and occipital lobe non-reperfusion ( MD = -1.68 , p = 0.001 ) were associated with worse mental status improvement while left-sided stroke ( MD = 2.02 , p < 0.001 ) featured better improvement post-thrombectomy .
