In a multivariate logistic regression model after adjusting for age , sex , race/ethnicity , hospital teaching status , comorbidities , and all patients refined diagnosis-related groups-based disease severity , patients admitted to a TCH were found to have low incidence of in-hospital adverse events : pneumonia ( OR = 0.86 , 0.95 CI 0.78 to 0.93 ) , urinary tract infection ( OR = 0.87 , 0.95 CI 0.84 to 0.91 ) , sepsis ( OR = 0.91 , 0.95 CI 0.81 to 1.02 ) , and pulmonary embolism ( OR = 0.89 , 0.95 CI 0.77 to 1.03 ) ; in-hospital death ( OR = 0.82 , 0.95 CI 0.78 to 0.88 ) ; and higher rate of home discharge ( OR = 1.09 , 0.95 CI 1.06 to 1.12 ) .
