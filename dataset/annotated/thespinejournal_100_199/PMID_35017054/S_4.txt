METHODS : To isolate the subsidence performance contributed by each porous cage design feature , namely the stress-optimized body lattice ( vs. a solid body ) and microporous endplates ( vs. smooth endplates ) , four groups of cages ( two-by-two combination of these two features ) were tested in : ( 1 ) static axial compression of the cage ( per ASTM F2077 ) and ( 2 ) static subsidence ( per ASTM F2267 ) .
