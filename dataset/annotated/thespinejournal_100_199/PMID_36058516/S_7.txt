The maximal values from eight strain gauges ( P-R-O : outer cortex of right pedicle in proximal vertebra ; P-R-I : inner cortex of right pedicle in proximal vertebra ; D-R-O : outer cortex of right pedicle in distal vertebra ; D-R-I : inner cortex of right pedicle in distal vertebra ; P-L-O : outer cortex of left pedicle in proximal vertebra ; P-L-I : inner cortex of left pedicle in proximal vertebra ; D-L-O : outer cortex of left pedicle in distal vertebra ; D-L-I : outer cortex of left pedicle in proximal vertebra ) for each specimen during tightening to 12 Nm were measured .
