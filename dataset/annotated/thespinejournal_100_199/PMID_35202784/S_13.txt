Despite these differences , the SORG prediction model retained good discrimination ( area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 and the area under the precision-recall curve of 0.33 ) and good overall performance ( Brier score of 0.028 compared with null model Brier score of 0.030 ) while somewhat overestimating the chance of prolonged opioid use ( calibration slope of 1.07 and calibration intercept of -0.87 ) .
