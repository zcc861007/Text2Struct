There was a larger change in quantitative Romberg measurements with eyes open versus eyes closed in CSM patients compared to normal volunteers for maximum lateral movement ( 10.79 cm vs. 0.94 cm , p = .003 ) , maximum anterior-posterior movement ( 15.06 cm vs. 10.00 cm p = .201 ) , total lateral CoP movement ( 89.82 cm vs. 18.71 cm , p = .007 ) , total AP CoP movement ( 154.68 cm vs. 87.47 cm , p = .601 ) , total CoP trace movement ( 199.79 cm vs. 88.44 cm , p = .014 ) , sway area ( 284.74 cm ( 2 ) vs. 57.76 cm ( 2 ) , p = .006 ) , and average speed ( 7.00 cm/s vs. 2.91 cm/s , p = .006 ) .
