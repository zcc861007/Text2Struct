RESULT : There was significant difference in intraoperative time period and procedure cost for the patients treated with Vertebroplasty ( 50.75 min , 25 k ) in comparison to balloon kyphoplasty ( 71.95 , 50 k ) with p value being < .001 There was significant difference between preoperative and postoperative study parameters in both the study groups but there was no significant difference in post operative study parameters amongst both the study groups with p values > .05 for different parameters , 0.381 ( Gain in vertebral height ) , 0.108 ( pain relief ) , 0.846 ( Oswestry disability index ) and 0.197 ( risk of cement leakage ) CONCLUSION : Our study suggested that percutaneous vertebroplasty requires less operative time and is more economical than balloon kyphoplasty .
