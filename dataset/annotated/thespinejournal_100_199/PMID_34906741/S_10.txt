Quantitative histometric bone implant contact demonstrated significantly more contact in the 3D-pTi implants versus PEEK ( p < .001 ) ; region of interest calculations also demonstrated significantly greater osseous and cartilaginous interdigitation at the implant-native bone interface with the 3D-pTi cages ( p = .008 and p = .015 , respectively ) .
