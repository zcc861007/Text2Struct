METHODS : We ( 1 ) simulated 1000 datasets for each number of ODI items ( 1 - 9 ) for which data could be missing by randomly setting items to missing ; ( 2 ) calculated simulated scores using AS or MI ; ( 3 ) calculated absolute percentage error ( APE ) of simulated vs. true scores ; ( 4 ) classified disability level using the simulated score ; and ( 5 ) compared APE between scoring methods to assess precision and misclassification rates .
