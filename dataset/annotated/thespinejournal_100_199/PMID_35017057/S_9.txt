Minimally invasive SI joint fusion with the iFuse Implant System appeared to result in larger improvements in pain ( two RCTs : mean difference in visual analog scale -40.5 mm , 0.95 CI , -50.1 to -30.9 ; -38.1 mm , p < .0001 ) and larger improvements in physical function ( mean difference in Oswestry Disability Index -25.4 points , 0.95 CI , -32.5 to -18.3 ; -19.8 points , p < .0001 ) compared to conservative management at 6 months .
