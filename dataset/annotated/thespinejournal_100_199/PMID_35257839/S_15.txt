Despite a low AUC for NRS-Arm pain and readmission , HbA1c levels above 6.8 may be associated with failure to achieve MCID for NRS-Arm pain ( AUC = 0.61 , 0.95 CI 0.49 - 0.73 , p = .094 ) , and HbA1c levels above 7.6 may be associated with higher readmission rate ( AUC = 0.63 , 0.95 CI 0.50 - 0.75 , p = .185 ) .
