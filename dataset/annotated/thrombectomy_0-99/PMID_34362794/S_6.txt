Patients in the hyperglycemia group were less likely to have a modified Ranking Scale ( mRS ) score < 3 ( risk ratio ( RR ) : 0.65 ; 0.95 CI 0.59 to 0.72 ; p < 0.0001 ; I2 = 0.13 ) , and had an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage ( sICH ) ( RR : 2.07 ; 0.95 CI 1.65 to 2.60 ; p < 0.0001 ; I2 = 0 ) and mortality ( RR : 1.73 ; 0.95 CI 1.57 to 1.91 ; p < 0.0001 ; I2 = 0 ) .
