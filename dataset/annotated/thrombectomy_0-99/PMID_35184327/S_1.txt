METHODS : In a pooled , patient-level analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials ( EXTEND-IA , EXTEND-and IA-TNK parts 1 and 2 ) and 2 prospective nonrandomized studies ( INSPIRE and SELECT ) , we evaluated EVT association with 90-day functional independence ( modified Rankin Scale [ mRS ] = 0 - 2 ) in isolated M2 occlusions as compared to medical management overall and in subgroups by mismatch profile status and stroke severity .
