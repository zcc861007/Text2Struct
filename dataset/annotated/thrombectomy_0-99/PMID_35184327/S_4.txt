Compared to MM , EVT was more frequently associated with functional independence ( 0.683 vs 0.616 , adjusted odds ratio [ aOR ] = 2.42 , 0.95 confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.25 - 4.67 , p = 0.008 , inverse probability of treatment weights [ IPTW ] - OR = 1.75 , 0.95 CI = 1.00 - 3.75 , p = 0.05 ) with a shift toward better mRS outcomes ( adjusted cOR = 2.02 , 0.95 CI : 1.23 - 3.29 , p = 0.005 ) , and lower mortality ( 0.05 vs 0.1 , aOR = 0.32 , 0.95 CI = 0.12 - 0.87 , p = 0.025 ) .
