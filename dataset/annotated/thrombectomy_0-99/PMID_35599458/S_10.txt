In 414 subjects ( 0.767 ) with target mismatch , EVT was associated with improved functional independence ( EVTpri : 0.774 vs MMpri : 0.727 , aOR = 1.68 , 0.95 CI = 1.01 - 2.81 , p = 0.048 ) , whereas there was a trend toward less favorable outcomes with primary EVT ( EVTpri : 0.774 vs MMpri : 0.833 , aOR = 0.39 , 0.95 CI = 0.12 - 1.34 , p = 0.13 ) without target mismatch ( pinteraction = 0.06 ) .
