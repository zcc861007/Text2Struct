The pooled analysis showed that MT might be not associated with functional prognosis among mild AIS with LVO ( excellent functional prognosis : risk ratio ( RR ) = 1.07 , 0.95 confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.94 - 1.21 , p = 0.294 ; favorable functional prognosis : RR = 1.01 , 0.95 CI = 0.96 - 1.06 , p = 0.823 ) .
