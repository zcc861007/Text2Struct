As for patients with low ASPECTS , pooled results indicated a higher odds of good functional outcome ( OR = 3.47 ; 0.95 CI 1.99 to 6.07 ; P < 0.0001 , I2 = 0.66 ) and a lower risk of mortality ( OR = 0.62 ; 0.95 CI 0.46 to 0.83 ; P = 0.001 , I2 = 0.32 ) in thrombectomy group compared with no thrombectomy group , but the risk of sICH or PH2 did not differ between two groups .
