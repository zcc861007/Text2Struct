The late-presenting group had more atherothrombotic cerebral infarction ( 0.19 versus 0.06 , respectively ; P = 0.03 ) , smaller hypoperfusion volume ( median : 77 versus 133 mL , respectively ; P = 0.04 ) , and slower infarct growth velocity ( median : 0.6 versus 5.1 mL/h , respectively ; P = 0.03 ) .
